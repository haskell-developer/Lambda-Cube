# Lambda Calculus Examples

A series of Lambda Calculus implementations starting from Simply Typed
evaluation, then work up through bidirectional typechecking,
normalization by evaluation, elaboration and then various type system
extensions.

The goal is to provide best practices examples of all the features you
might want to include in your custom language in one place.
