# Lambda Calculus Examples

This repo contains a variety of Lambda Calculus implementations with
different combinations of normalization strategy and type
systems. Each implementation exists in a single file and attempts to
minimize Haskell-isms.


## Implementations:

#### [Untyped Lambda Calculus](./main/Untyped.hs):
- Alpha Conversion
- Reduction based normalization

#### [Untyped Lambda Calculus NBE](./main/UntypedNBE.hs):
- Alpha Conversion
- Normalization by Evaluation

#### [Simply Typed Lambda Calculus](./main/SimplyTyped.hs):
- Alpha Conversion
- Reduction based normalization
- Bool and Unit primitive type examples

#### [System T](./main/SystemT.hs):
- Alpha Conversion
- Reduction based normalization
- Bool and Unit primitive type examples
- Natural Numbers
- Primitive recursion

#### [Simply Typed Lambda Calculus NBE](./main/SimplyTypedNBE.hs):
- DeBruijn Indices/Levels
- Normalization by Evaluation
- Bool and Unit primitive type examples

#### [System F](./main/SystemF.hs):

- Reduction based normalization
- Bool and Unit primitive type examples

#### [System Omega](./main/SystemOmega.hs):
- Alpha Conversion
- Reduction based normalization
- Bool and Unit primitive type examples

#### [System F-Omega](./main/SystemFOmega.hs):
- Alpha Conversion
- Reduction based normalization
